                            <h2>About</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>The name Rageguy refers to the main character of a series of crudely-drawn comics typically
                            consisting of four panes, portraying situations which can bring rage and exasperation, with
                            the main character screaming with anger as a result. Due to its simplicity and
                            exploitability, Rageguy has been proven popular thus being evolved into a comic series now
                            known as Rage Comics.

                            <h2>Origin</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>The first instance of Rageguy came in 2008 on the 4chan "Random" (/b/) imageboard. The image
                            consisted of a 4-pane comic made in MS Paint portraying the "toilet splashback"
                            experience[1]. The first three panes described the incidence and in the fourth pane, a
                            drawing of Rageguy screaming appeared with a caption saying "FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU-" on the
                            right of the face in red letters.
                        </p>

                        </header>
                        <p>After the first Rageguy instance, other derivatives began to appear. The format of the
                            comics remained, for the most part, the same, with the rage-inducing instance being
                            described in the first three panes and the Rageguy face screaming on the fourth.
