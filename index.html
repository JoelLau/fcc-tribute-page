                    <p>Nyan Cat, also known as Pop Tart Cat, is an 8-bit animation depicting a cat with the body of a
                        cherry Pop-Tart flying through outer space. While absurd themes like flying kittens and pastry
                        cats have been around for some time, the surreal humor behind this particular combination has
                        captivated YouTubers and online art communities, spawning fan illustrations as well as
                        user-interface designs and homebrew games across multiple platforms.
