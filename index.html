                    </header>
                    <p>The name Rageguy refers to the main character of a series of crudely-drawn comics typically
                        consisting of four panes, portraying situations which can bring rage and exasperation, with
                        the main character screaming with anger as a result. Due to its simplicity and
                        exploitability, Rageguy has been proven popular thus being evolved into a comic series now
                        known as Rage Comics.

                    </header>
                    <p>The first instance of Rageguy came in 2008 on the 4chan "Random" (/b/) imageboard. The image
                        consisted of a 4-pane comic made in MS Paint portraying the "toilet splashback"
                        experience[1]. The first three panes described the incidence and in the fourth pane, a
                        drawing of Rageguy screaming appeared with a caption saying "FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU-" on the
                        right of the face in red letters.

                        <h2>Spread</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>After the first Rageguy instance, other derivatives began to appear. The format of the
                        comics remained, for the most part, the same, with the rage-inducing instance being
                        described in the first three panes and the Rageguy face screaming on the fourth.
